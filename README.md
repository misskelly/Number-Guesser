# Number Guesser

This project was the first paired project that either of us has ever attempted. The project was not only a test of our coding abilities, but also a test of our ability to work together as a team. We can both attest to growth in our ability to use HTML and CSS, which are becoming more familiar as we near the end of week three of our coding journey. Additionally, we have developed tremendously in our understanding of JavaScript, which is a new language for both of us. While we are both proud of our coding development, we are equally proud of the soft-skills that we developed throughout this paired project. We have both learned how to voice our concerns, discuss the inevitable issues that arise during coding, and also how to share the workload. The process has taken a lot of time and energy, but we both understand how much we learned from the project and from each other. 

# Goals 

- Successfully navigating a paired assignment
- Creating well structured, semantic HTML
- Creating clean, precise, and D.R.Y. ("Don't Repeat Yourself") CSS
- Gaining a solid understanding of a new language, JavaScript

# Motivation

Both of us wanted to work well together. We met early each morning and we worked around busy personal and Turing schedules. We both wanted to utilize our time wisely and effectively. 

# Built with

- Sublime
- DevTools on Google Chrome Canary

# Languages Built in 

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

# Screen Grab of Static Comp Provided


# Screen Grab of the Site Created


# Shortcomings

Both of us would have liked to complete Phase Three of the project, which would have added additional functionality to our Number Guesser.

# Learning during production

If there was a chart that could have tracked what we learned in a short time, it would look something like this:

Not a day went by that we did not experiment and learn. We learned as much about coding as we did about how to work as members of a team.
